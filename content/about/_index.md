**Bio.** I have completed my D.Phil in Computer Science at the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Dr. İsmail İlkan Ceylan][1] and [Prof. Thomas Lukasiewicz][2]. Broadly, my research interests lie in the area of
 graph representation learning (GRL). More specifically, I am interested in identifying the strengths and limitations of GRL models, namely knowledge base embedding models and graph neural networks (GNNs),
and proposing theory-driven machine learning approaches with provably improved inductive capacity, interpretability, and representation power for better learning and inference 
 over relational data.

Previously, I have worked on sentiment-aware music composition (B.E. final project) and neural program synthesis (M.Sc. thesis). Moreover, I am currently working on transformer models 
and natural language processing with [the Learning Agency Lab][3], and am supporting the Learning Engineering program at [Schmidt Futures][4].
