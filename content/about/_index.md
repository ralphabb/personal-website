**Current Work.** I am a Program Scientist at [Renaissance Philanthropy][1] (RenPhil), leading AI work in the organization's AI for Math and AI for Education portfolios.

**Previous Roles.** Before joining RenPhil, I worked at the [Learning Engineering Virtual Institute][4] (now also housed at Renaissance), initially at [Schmidt Futures][6], then at the [Digital Harbor Foundation][7]. 
Previously, I [completed a D.Phil][5] in Computer Science from the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Dr. İsmail İlkan Ceylan][2] and [Prof. Thomas Lukasiewicz][3], with my research focusing on graph representation learning (GRL).
